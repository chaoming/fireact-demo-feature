# This is a demo for Fireact dummy features

This project contains three dummy pages as a module of Fireact features. You can follow the same approach to build your own SaaS features on top of Fireact.

Fireact scans `*FeatureRoutes.js` files in under the `features` folder to create routes to features built in modules, and scans `*FeatureMenu.js` files to add menu items to the left hand side account menu.
